		<h1>Welcome to TaskUnifier Help</h1>
		
		<p>
		TaskUnifier is a task management software based on the well-known GTD (Getting things done) methodology.<br />
		It will help you manage your tasks and therefore your time.<br />
		<br />
		TaskUnifier is free and open source.<br />
		Only the synchronization with third-party websites requires plugins which are independent from TaskUnifier's project.<br />
		The plugins can be free or not.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Things to know</h2>
		
		<h3>1) Task Searcher</h3>
		<p>
		Via the "+" button on the bottom left of the screen, you can create your own filters.
		<br />
		The filters allows you to display only some tasks and also allows you to sort them.
		For more information <a href="./task_searcher.html">click here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>2) Task Template</h3>
		<p>
		Via the menu "Tasks -> Manage task templates", you can create and edit your own templates.
		<br />

		For more information <a href="./manage_task_templates.html">click here</a>.

		<h3>3) Synchronization</h3>
		<p>
		Via "Settings -> Synchronization", you can select a synchronization plugin which will allow you to synchronize
		your data with a third-party website or application like Toodledo.<br /><br />
		It is a two-way synchronization, which means your data will be the same in TaskUnifier or in the third-party website or application.
		<br /><br />
		Only one synchronization plugin can be enabled.

		<h3>4) Publication</h3>
		<p>
		Via "Settings -> Publication", you can select a publication plugin which will allow you to publish
		your data to a third-party website or application like Google Calendar.<br /><br />
		It is a one-way publication, which means your data from TaskUnifier will be sent to the third-party website or application but
		if you change something in the third-party website or application, these changes won't be replicated in TaskUnifier.
		<br /><br />
		You can enable as many publication plugins you want.
